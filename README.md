billion-placeholder
===================

*Placeholder while working on Kaggle HowTo* 

A working solution to the [Billion Word Imputation challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/billion-word-imputation/) 
will appear here shortly (expected ~15-Jan-2015).


And so it ends...
-------------------

Only submittable results were produced by code in ```<THIS-REPO>/go_src```
Which took about a weekend to write.

There's probably enough 'juice' in the pure bigram approach (which is all
that is done in go_src) to get to #8 from current #12, 
but no futher, since there is a step-wise change between #8 amd #7.

But time would be better spent (i) sleeping; (ii) working on something 
that can be submitted to a conference instead.
